# GLOLogistics Inventory Management System

A Spring Boot console-based application with Spring Data JPA for managing inventory, orders, and customers in a logistics company.

## Project Overview

The Inventory Management System streamlines inventory-related operations for GLOLogistics, reducing errors, minimizing overstocking or understocking, and providing valuable insights for decision-making. The system implements a role-based approach with separate functionalities for customers and administrators, backed by a PostgreSQL database.

## Technology Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.1.4
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL Database
- Spring AOP for logging
- Maven for dependency management
- Lombok for reducing boilerplate code

## Database Setup

### PostgreSQL Installation and Setup

1. Download and install PostgreSQL from [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. During installation:
   - Remember the password you set for the 'postgres' user
   - Default port is 5432 (keep this unless you have a reason to change)

3. Create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE glologistics_db;
   ```

### Database Configuration

The application is configured to connect to PostgreSQL using the following properties in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/glologistics_db
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres
```

To use different credentials, modify these properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

### Schema Management

The application uses Hibernate's auto-ddl feature to automatically create and update the database schema:
```properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

This will create the following tables:
- `customers` - Stores customer information
- `products` - Stores product details
- `orders` - Stores order information with relationships to customers and products

## Features

### Customer Functionalities
- View all available products with details (ID, name, description, price, stock)
- Place orders for products
- View order history
- Cancel pending orders
- Register as a new customer

### Administrator Functionalities
- Add new products to the inventory
- Update existing product quantities
- Approve/reject customer orders
- View all order requests

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

#### Customer Entity
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact_number VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(500)
);
```

#### Product Entity
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    product_description VARCHAR(1000),
    product_price DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    quantity_in_stock INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

#### Order Entity
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    customer_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    product_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES products(product_id),
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    total_amount DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    order_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT fk_customer FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_product FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running
   ```bash
   # Check PostgreSQL status on Windows
   sc query postgresql
   
   # Check PostgreSQL status on Linux
   systemctl status postgresql
   ```

2. Create the database (using psql or pgAdmin)
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE glologistics_db;
   ```

3. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stefi19/GLOLogistics-Inventory-Management.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd GLOLogistics-Inventory-Management
   ```

5. Update database credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties` if needed
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

6. Build the project
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

7. Run the application
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The application will automatically create the necessary database tables on first run.

## Usage

After starting the application, you'll be presented with a main menu:

1. Login as Customer
2. Login as Admin
3. Register as New Customer
4. Exit

### Customer Workflow
1. Register as a new customer to get your customer ID
2. Login using your customer ID
3. Browse available products
4. Place orders for products
5. View your order history
6. Cancel any pending orders

### Admin Workflow
1. Login as admin
2. Manage products (add new, update stock)
3. View all orders in the system
4. Approve or reject pending orders

## Technical Features

### Exception Handling
- Custom exceptions for business logic
- Global exception handler for consistent error management
- Proper validation of inputs and business rules

### Logging
- AOP-based logging for all service operations
- Detailed logging for critical operations (orders, stock updates)
- Exception logging for troubleshooting

### Concurrency
- Thread-safe implementations using ConcurrentHashMap
- Atomic operations for ID generation
- Safe stock management during order processing
